# codeforces
I recently started coding on **codeforces** platform. The purpose of this repo is to store all my submissions on codeforces. Additionally I will also add the initial/raw logics that ultimately helped me write my final submit.

LEGEND:<br>
<li>Level 0 : Super Easy</li>
<li>Level 1 : Easy</li>
<li>Level 2 : Somewhere between easy and moderate</li>
